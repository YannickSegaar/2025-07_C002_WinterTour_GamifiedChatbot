Er ontstaat een behoefte om kennis in huis te halen die de transitie naar een meer commercieel beleid in gang kan zetten.

Deze behoefte kan ook ontstaan als u besluit om het dienstverband van een Sales Manager te gaan beëindigen of als de desbetreffende persoon dat zelf heeft besloten. Er ontstaat een leemte omdat er dan vaak geen commercieel aanspreekpersoon meer aanwezig is.

In deze situaties kunt u een beroep doen op de professionele Interim Sales management dienst van VDF Sales, uw partner in acquisitie. VDF Sales staat u graag ""on the job"" terzijde bij de herstructurering, optimalisatie of tijdelijke bewaking van de realisatie van uw commerciële doelen.

Afhankelijk van de intensiteit van de gewenste ondersteuning kan VDF Sales salesprocessen optimaliseren en implementeren danwel de lijnverantwoordelijkheid tijdelijk voor u overnemen. Of het nu gaat om strategische beslissingen of operationele sales werkprocessen. VDF Sales neemt de zaken praktisch ter hand en zal gezamenlijk met u werken aan tastbare en solide resultaten.

VDF Sales verzorgd regelmatig gastlezingen / presentaties over het werven van nieuwe klanten voor bedrijven, business evenementen en netwerk verenigingen. Aan de hand van praktijkvoorbeelden en tips worden de aanwezigen in hoog tempo geënthousiasmeerd.

Kern van het verhaal van VDF Sales is om ondernemers / organisaties handvatten te geven zodat zij met minder moeite betere commerciële resultaten weten te behalen en leren om op een persoonlijke, creatieve en originele manier nieuwe klanten te werven. Alle voorbeelden komen uit de dagelijkse praktijk en worden onderbouwd met resultaten. Geen abstracte theorie uit het boekje dus, maar alles uit eigen ervaring!
